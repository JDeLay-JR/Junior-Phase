# Schema Design

## Data Modeling
- How do we represent real world relationships and properties in our program?
  - ...in a way that makes writing the programs easy?

## Designing a Schema
- **Normalization**
  - The process of organizaing the columns and tables of a relational database to mininmize data redundancy
  - The goal of schema design is to achieve data normalization while thinking about how your data is going to work
    - Sometimes some data redundancy makes for a simpler data base
- Steps for Developing an ERD
  - Identify entities
  - Define relationships
  - Draw a rough-draft
  - Fill in cardinality/modality (arrows with relationship types)
